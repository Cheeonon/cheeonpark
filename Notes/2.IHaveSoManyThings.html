    <h1>I Have So Many Things to Do</h1>
    <p>I just have too many interests. I don't limit myself to specific area, and my interests can be anything, and totally unrelatable to me. I just get to have interest on random things and start to learn it.
    </p>
    <p>However, I can also say there's is sort of rule when it comes to choose which one i should learn first. I usually pick one that seems to be helpful in the future. Such as, French and programing. I would just put something like guitar or game aside because I don't see it helpful(at leastv for now) thus look for something else that can be helpful in the near future. </p>
    <p>I just realised how messy the way this post is going is, I'm too tired and almost falling in sleep, so... I guess I'll just see you tomorrow. </p>

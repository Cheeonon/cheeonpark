    <h1>What Do I Want To Write Down?</h1>
    <p>This will be my frist blog post. I know blog isn't a thing thesedays and probably vlog is a better way to choose to share my thoughts with random people. The thing is, I live with my mom and I just don't want to "share my thoughts" loudly to her face...., as our home is tiny little cozy one room one dan house.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I don't know what I want to share. I don't even have any rough ideas that I want to talk, so posts I post here will be basically anything that i'm writing down for the sake of writing. </p>
    <p>One of many reasons of this blog is to practice my English skills. I mean, the ability to think and talk in English. It's been about 7 years living in English-speaking country, and I got to realize one very important thing recently. It is that English is just a tool that I want to use to communicate with people. Speaking in English itself is not hard, but speaking what I want to say is the hard part when we speak in foreign language.</p>
    <p>When I was in New Zealand, I remember my accent was occasioanlly mocked by my friends. I may be stressed out because of that and I started to study English (as my memory serves, it was my first time studying something not useless). Because my friends were making fun of me with my accent, all I cared about was pronounciation. I read books aloud and record myself. I would listen to the record file and spent hours to find the "proper" way to pronounce.</p>
    <p>Now that I think about it, I could live more delightful life in New Zealand if I didn't focus on my accent but who I am talking to. I was too afraid to be looked stupid.</p>
